   Arbiter: An arbiter takes an input and sets it's output to be 1 where the
   MSB of the input was 1. For example, 0110 would become 0100. If there are
   no 1's in the input, the output is 0. These are helpful for settling disputes
   over some resource as only one of the output bits will ever be high.
