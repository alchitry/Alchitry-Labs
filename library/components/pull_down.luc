   Pull Down: This module can be used to fake a pulldown resistor
   by setting the pin to an output and pulling it low for a 
   brief period of time. It then releases it and takes a reading
   of the value. This is repeated over an over so that the output
   of this module looks as if it was simply an input with a 
   pulldown.
