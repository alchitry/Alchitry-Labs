   Pseudo-random Number Generator: This module generates pseudo-random 32bit 
   numbers based on Xorshift (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift). The
   numbers shouldn't be used for crypto applications, but should be fine for
   most applications where numbers need to just appear to be random.
   
   The output, num, is updated when next is high. Next can be tied high for
   continuous number generation.
   
   The module can be reset with seed set to the same input to generate the 
   exact same sequence of "random" numbers. By setting a different seed on
   a reset you can generate a different set of random numbers.
