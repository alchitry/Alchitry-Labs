   Decoder: A decoder takes a binary encoded number
   (think regular number) and turns it into a 
   one-hot representation. That means that the
   bit that corresponds to the value of the input
   is one. So if you feed in 0, the LSB is 1. If
   you feed in 1 the next bit is 1 and everything
   else is 0. It's called one-hot since there is
   only ever one bit high.

  always {
    out = 0;     // default to 0
    out[in] = 1; // set selected bit to 1
