/**
 * Flow Control
 * <p>
 * The FT245R, FT2232C (in FIFO mode) and FT245BM chips use their own
 * handshaking as an integral part of its design, by proper use of the TXE#
 * line. The FT232R, FT2232C (in UART mode) and FT232BM chips can use RTS/CTS,
 * DTR/DSR hardware or XOn/XOff software handshaking. It is highly recommended
 * that some form of handshaking be used.
 * <p>
 * It is strongly encouraged that flow control is used because it is impossible
 * to ensure that the Ftdi driver will always be scheduled. The chip can buffer
 * up to 384 bytes of data. Windows can 'starve' the driver program of time if
 * it is doing other things. The most obvious example of this is moving an
 * application around the screen with the mouse by grabbing its task bar. This
 * will result in a lot of graphics activity and data loss will occur if
 * receiving data at 115200 baud (as an example) with no handshaking.
 * <p>
 * If the data rate is low or data loss is acceptable then flow control may be
 * omitted.
